<br>
11<br>
00:00:19,100 to 00:00:21,933<br>
reduces complexity and catered to a primary persona<br>
<br>
12<br>
00:00:22,300 to 00:00:24,200<br>
Emily is the primary persona<br>
<br>
13<br>
00:00:24,400 to 00:00:27,100<br>
she's a busy individual that values her health<br>
<br>
14<br>
00:00:27,166 to 00:00:29,066<br>
We took her values into consideration<br>
<br>
15<br>
00:00:29,066 to 00:00:30,666<br>
by making a visually appealing app<br>

that takes his belief into consideration<br>
<br>
22<br>
00:00:44,566 to 00:00:46,000<br>
